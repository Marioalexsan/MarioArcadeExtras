# MarioArcadeExtras
A mod for Secrets of Grindea that adds additional content to Arcade Mode, created using GrindScript.

# How to install

1. Download the latest release
2. Unpack the .zip inside Secrets of Grindea's folder (the game executable and GrindScriptLauncher.exe should be in the same folder as a result)
3. Copy your arcademode.sav save file from `%appdata%\Secrets of Grindea` to `%appdata%\GrindScript`
    1. Create GrindScript folder if it doesn't exist
    2. This is so that you can mess around with the mod without breaking your vanilla save files
4. Launch the game using GrindScriptLauncher.exe
